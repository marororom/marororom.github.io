                        <h5>Info</h5>
                        This project is based on an university group assignment in cooperation with Wikimedia Sweden. The project took place between February and March 2015.
                        <br>
                        <h5>Background</h5>
                        Wikipedia has a few main issues. A decreasing number of editors, little diversity (> 80% male), “female” topics are covered less than “male” topics, reluctance to changes by core-users and in addittion to that, only a few readers/"normal users" are interested in becoming contributors.
                        <br>
                        <h5>Challenge</h5>
                        Develop a proposal that is based upon a firm consideration of its consequences, including ethical, for Wikipedia and the society as a whole.
                        <br>
                        <h5>Role</h5>
                        UX Designer, Interaction Designer and Visual Designer
                        <br>
                        <h5>Approach</h5>
                        Individually we did research about the problems that Wikipedia is facing. Together we discussed our findings and analyzed surveys. We identified accessibility as the main aspect we have to focus on in order to attract a wider and more diverse group of people. Only one of us edited Wikipedia before the project. So we tried editing Wikipedia ourselves and we were able to confirm our research findings. We created a list of requirements that we needed to work on in order to improve the accessibility. Based on these requirements we started to design our version of Wikipedia. Due to given time constraints, our main focus were the main page, the article page, the talk page, the history page and the user page.

                        <br>
                        <h5>Main page</h5>
                        <p>One of the first major changes we decided upon was to recede the size of the main menu. It is easy to make it smaller, using an accordion, so that menus can be expanded and collapsed. One of our research findings was, that knowing about specific topic areas which needed help would turn non-contributors into participants. We decided that this was an important feature to make people both aware of what they can do, but also encouraging them to do so by making it more accessible. So we added “Take part!” to the menu, with prominent green background, an overview about different possibilities of taking part. We also changed the “Interaction” menu to “Community” instead, as that is what you’re interacting with - the community.<br><br>
                        To deal with the hidden search syntax issue on Wikipedia, we added a feature that already exists on the Wikimedia Commons site. We added, beneath the search function, options to search in specific parts of the site. By adding this search options and moving the search next to the Wikipedia logo, we increase availability, by increasing awareness and accessibility.<br><br>
                        Another issue was the cluttered main page, where all kinds of featured texts crowd one another. Even though all these features are something we want to make more prominent, we also want to make them more attractive and less intimidating. We chose to design them similarly to common widgets on other sites.</p>
